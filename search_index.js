RMA.jl is an efficient Julia package for RMA, which supports a wide range of motif shapes, flexible sampling strategies, and comprehensive distribution computation capabilities. Furthermore, RMA.jl also features an optimized pipeline for stimating standard RQA quantifiers with significantly reduced memory and computational requirements, making it particularly well-suited for large-scale dataset.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Welcome","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Welcome","title":"Welcome","text":"Download Julia 1.8 or later, preferably the current stable release.
