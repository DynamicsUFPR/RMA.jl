# Utilitary functions

`RMA.jl` has several utilitary functions to help when using the library. These functions allows to simplify the process to implement recurrence analysis to a project, facilitating the set of a threshold, or the preparation of continuous data to be analysed.

!!! warning
    Some function presented in this section was still in development, so these function can change in future versions.

## Preparing a continuous data
When working with continuous data, it is important to do a discretization, changing the time resolution to improve the available information. `prepare` is an utilitary function to discretize the data, applying a vicinity parameter to change the data time resolution.
```@repl utils
function lorenz!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = 10.0 * (u[2] - u[1])
    du[2] = u[1] * (28.0 - u[3]) - u[2]
    du[3] = u[1] * u[2] - (8 / 3) * u[3]
end

using DifferentialEquations, RMA
u0 = [1.0; 0.0; 0.0];
tspan = (0.0, 1000.0);
prob = ODEProblem(lorenz!, u0, tspan);
sol = solve(prob);

data_prepared = prepare(sol, 0.2)
```

!!! info    
    It is possible to see the difference between the data solution and the prepareted data when we make a RP.

The `prepare` function can also apply a transient phase to the data, using the **kword** `transient`, and select the max data length, using the **kword** `max_length`.
```@repl utils
data_prepared = prepare(sol, 0.2; transient = 6000, max_length = 1000)
```

!!! todo
    The `prepare` function does not normalize the data. In the future, we pretend to add this functionality.

##  Finding threshold
!!! todo
    We need to improve this function, the current version is just for tests. In the future, the function presented here also will be able to compute a vicinity parameter.

The threshold is a free parameter that need to be defined by the user when working with RP, RQA, or RMA. Using the principle of maximizing the recurrence entropy, we build a function to estimate a good value for threshold that can in some situations. The `find_parameters` function returns a `Float64` value to be used as threshold and the maximazed entropy. It is important to note that this function can be a little slower, since it needs to compute a recurrence motif distributions for each threshold in some interval.

```@repl utils
th, s = find_parameters(data_prepared, 3; threshold_max = 50.0)
```

!!! danger
    The current version has a bug with the **kword** `threshold_max`, since it is not automatically adjusted based on input. So, it is important to define a `threshold_max` for avoid problems, such as:
    ```@repl utils
    th, s = find_parameters(data_prepared, 3)
    ```

    We will improve `find_parameters` function and fix this issue in the next updates ðŸ˜‰
